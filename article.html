            <p style="align-self: flex-start;">Over a year before the Presidential Election, presidential candidates of both parties begin campaigning for your vote and support.</p>
            <p style="align-self: flex-end;">At this point, the only reason for a candidate to drop out of the race is for a lack of campaign funds. This is why your financial support in the form of donations and/or campaign merch is very important to the candidates.</p>
            <p style="align-self: flex-start;">Your first opportunity to vote for the next president is at the State Primary Elections. A candidate's popularity at these elections will help determine who receives the corresponding party nomination.</p>
            <p style="align-self: flex-end;">Finally, at the corresponding party convention, a nominee is chosen. These nominees are the candidates with the greatest chance of winning the Presidential Election.</p>
            <p style="align-self: flex-start;">On November 3rd, 2020, you vote for the next president in the Presidential Election.</p>

                Announcement of Presidential Campaigns
            </h3>
            <p>
                Over a year prior to the presidential election, people with various backgrounds begin announcing their candidacy for the nomination of their respective party, including the current president. The incumbent president is not automatically assumed to run for reelection, though it is the case more often than not. The last president to refuse to seek reelection was President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. President Trump held his first campaign rally in February 2017, informally announcing his campaign for reelection.
                The first democratic candidate to announce their candidacy was Rep. Josh Delaney in July of the same year. In 2019, MA Governor Bill Weld became the first challenger to Donald Trump for the Republican Nomination.

                Candidates are campaigning for the support of the general population. You can support your favorite candidate by donating to their campaigns, or voting for them in national polls. 
                Your donations to a campaign allow it to use more resources, from paying campaign staff, to funding ads you may see on social media. Without abundant donators, the campaign will not be able to reach out to more potential supporters, which will eventually lead to its suspension.
                In addition, you can help your candidate qualify for Primary debates by voting for them in national polls.

                Primary Debates
            </h3>
            <p>
                Prior to any State Primary, debates are held to help voters make their decision. Qualified candidates are asked questions by debate moderators, which allow them to communicate to the general population what kind of president they aim to be. 
                Debate criteria is specific to each one, but in general, candidates need to meet a threshold in a number of national polls, or receive a certain number of donations. 
                Not qualifying for a debate is representative of a campaign's success. It is the only benchmark to meet before a state primary.
                <br>
                <br>

                Primary debates are organized by media outlets called 'sponsors'.

                State Primaries
            </h3>
            <p>
                Your state's primary election is your opportunity to vote for which candidate will receive your party's nomination. Iowa is the first state to hold it's primary in an election cycle, followed by New Hamspire. As the results come in, candidates who perform poorly are expected to drop out of the race.

                <br>
                <br>
                Your vote is what determines how the majority of your state's delegates will vote at your party's national convention. This majority of delegates are called 'pledged delegates'. The rest are called 'unpledged delegates' or 'superdelegates'.
                To win the party nomination, a candidate must receive a majority of delegate votes. The 2020 Democratic nominee needs 1,991 delegate votes, and 1,276 delegate votes for the Republican nominee.

                Primary dates change every election cycle. You can find your state's primary date <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Statewide_primary_elections_calendar'>here</a>.

            <p>
                Your party's nominee will be chosen at their respective national convention. The race for president peaked with 25+ candidates, but after the conventions, only 1 candidate from the two major political parties remain. 
                In addition, the parties will adopt a new platform that reflects their values.

                Presidential Debates
            </h3>
            <p>
                Presidential debates serve the same purpose as primary debates, but the only participants allowed in this debate are candidates with at least 15% support across five national polls. This pretty much excludes all third parties, leaving the debate stage to Democratic and Republican nominees.
                Vice presidential debates are held separately.
                <br><br>
                These debates help undecided voters find a candidate they can identify with. You can find the presidential debate schedule for 2020 on <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Important_dates_in_the_2020_presidential_race#General_election_debates'>Ballotpedia</a>.
