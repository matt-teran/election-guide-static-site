            <h3>Impeachment Resolutions</h3>
            <p>
                Any member of the House of Representatives may introduce an Impeachment Resolution. For example, on May 22, 2019, Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee (D-TX) introduced <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/396/text' class='article-link'>House Resolution 396</a> to direct the House Judicary Committee to investigate Donald Trump to determine if he is guilty of 'obstruction of justice,' 'abuse of power,' and more.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                An impeachment resolution on its own may not lead to impeachment, as with the one in the previous example, it only points to an investigation. The House Judiciary Committee will investigate the matter, then decide on the outcome by a simply majority vote.

            <h3>Congress Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                An investigation by Congress is the next step of the impeachment process. Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The investigation typically takes place in the House Judiciary Committee, but it can also take place in the House Rules Committee or even in the Senate. After the investigation, a recommendation will be given to the House regarding impeachment. If the investigating body finds grounds for impeachment, specific Articles of Impeachment will be passed for the House to vote on. Otherwise, the impeachment proceedings do not continue.

            <h3>Articles of Impeachment</h3>
            <p>Articles of impeachment state the charges and evidence against the president. The full House of Representatives votes on each. If the majority votes for an article, the president is then impeached, but not removed from office. For example, the articles drafted for the impeachment of Donald Trump were designated in <a class='article-link' href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/755'>House Resolution 755</a> and they accused him of "Abuse of power," and "Obstruction of Congress." The House then <a class='article-link' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Donald_Trump#House_vote'>voted as a majority</a> to agree with both articles, making Donald Trump the third president in United States history to be impeached.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the House majority does not vote for the articles, the impeachment process does not continue, otherwise it leads to a trial in the Senate. Prior to this trial, the House selects certain members to present the case to the Senate. These members are called "House managers." After Donald Trump was impeached, the House passed <a class='article-link' href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/798'>H.Res.798</a>, which appointed Representatives Schiff, Nadler, Lofgren, Jeffries, Demings, Crow, and Garcia as House managers.

            <h3>Senate Trial</h3>
            <p>
                The case is presented to the Senate by the appointed House managers, with the Chief Justice of United States (the highest-ranking officer of the judiciary branch) presiding over the trial. A two-thirds supermajority vote is required to convict the President and remove them from office.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the President is removed from office, they are not automatically forbidden to run again. This decision is made in a separate vote within the Senate. This vote will bar the impeached individual from holding a federal office in the future. It requires a simple majority vote.
